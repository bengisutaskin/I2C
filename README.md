# I2C
I2C Comm Arduino Mega 2560 and STM32F767ZI
STM32F767 is a master card, Arduino Mega 2650 and Arduino Nano are slave cards. Information from slave cards is read in STM.
This information is transferred on the Nextion screen.
I use STM32CubeIDE for STM32F7.
I use Arduino App for Arduinos.
I connected the SDA, SCL, +5V and GND pins of the cards as common on the breadboard.
STM32F7 and NEXTION Screen communicate via UART. I use USART1. I set the baudrate to 9600.
